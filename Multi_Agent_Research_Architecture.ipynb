        "This project is a multi-agent system (MAS) built to fulfill the coding task for the RCCIIT Internship shortlisting. The system uses the LangGraph framework  to create a chain of specialized AI agents that work together to answer complex research queries.\n",

        "### *Query Planner Agent:*\n",
        "This agent receives the user's query. It uses Tree of Thought (ToT) prompting to decompose the query into smaller, atomic questions and determines the best retrieval strategy (internal vector search, external web search, or both).\n",
        "\n",
        "### *Retriever Agent:*\n",
        "This agent conditionally fetches information based on the planner's strategy.\n",

        "\n",
        "### *Reviewer Agent:*\n",
        "This agent acts as a quality control step. It validates the factual consistency of the synthesized answer against the retrieved context and computes a faithfulness score.\n",

This leads to large memory savings, as we need to store only a subset of the parameters. For example, in Convolutional Neural Networks or CNNs, the same feature is computed across different regions of the image, and hence, a cat is detected irrespective of whether it is at the top or bottom of the image.\n",

Standard benchmarks for deep learning algorithms in computer vision include object recognition and OCR (Optical Character Recognition). Computer vision requires little preprocessing, and images should be standardized, so pixels lie in the same range.\n",
